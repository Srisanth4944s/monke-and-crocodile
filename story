once upon in the forest there lived a monkey on a beery tree, which was in a banks of a river.at the same forest there live crocdile and his wife
on day the crocdile came to the banks of river and rested under the tree.the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.the crocdile came the next day as he loved them
as days passed by the crocdile and monkey became good friends
one day the monkey sent some fruits for crocdile's wife she ate the fruits and liked them.but was geleous as she dint like her husband spending time with the monkey
she told her husband,"if the fruits are so juicy i wonder how sweet the monkey heart would be".
